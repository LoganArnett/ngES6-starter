# Angular 1.x, ES2015(or ES6), and Webpack Starter Repo
This repo is a starting point for build [Angular 1.x](https://angularjs.org/) applications while utilizing ES2015(or ES6) syntax, through [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) as our bundler.



The `master` branch has a basic setup without any real bells and whistles. It offers up some alternate options and some simple comments that can be removed or used depending on the project.

You will find alternative branches with various options setup and ready out of the box for you. If there are any setups that you would like to see added please open an issue or start a pull request to add it in.

I am building these for myself to have a good starting point for projects but would love to see the project grow.
